// requests with timestamps. What makes it different from a typical rate limiter is
// that there are two phases - The caller first requests for 'n' tokens, does
// some work, then either commits the tokens, or withdraws them so they can be
// requested by others. So at anytime, the running total represents the tokens
// committed in that period of time, plus those requested but not committed yet.
//
// If we are going to have millions of requests, we should switch to a sliding
// window implementation like https://github.com/RussellLuo/slidingwindow,
// which saves space with the cost of some inaccuracy.
